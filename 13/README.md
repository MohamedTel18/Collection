## Overview

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Multi-step form challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). The goal is to build a fully functional and responsive multi-step form, closely matching the provided design. Users can fill out multiple steps, review their information, and receive validation feedback throughout the process.

## Features

- Complete each step of a multi-step form sequence
- Navigate back and forth between steps to update selections
- Live summary and confirmation of selections on the final step
- Responsive layout for all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Interactive UI with hover and focus states for all elements
- Form validation with messages for:
  - Missing required fields
  - Incorrect email formatting
  - Submitting a step with no selection
